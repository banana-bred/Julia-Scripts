# Julia-Scripts
A small collection of Julia utility scripts and their associated wrappers that I use.

## Basic use
The Julia scripts can be run via the command line or with the help of one of the wrapper scripts.
Each wrapper script looks for its Julia script in the folder given by the environmental variable `JULIABIN`.
